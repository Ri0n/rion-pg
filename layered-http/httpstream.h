/*

  Network layers:
  1) If layer has set out data layer than all processed data will be send to
  this out layer.
  for example. ssl layer has http as out layer. so ssl decoded data will be
  written to http layer (ssl layer calls writeIncoming of http layer).
  2) If out layer is not set then processed data written directly to read buffer
  and readyRead emitted.
  3) When out layer finish to process incoming data it will go to step 1

  Each layer connect readyRead signal of out layer to readyRead signal of itself
  in case it don't want to make some additional postprocessing. When some
  external entity starts reading by readyRead signal from top of layers stack,
  each layer checks if it has out layer and tries to read from this out layer.
  If there is no out layer (bottom of stack) it reads from own read buffer.
